### Hi there 👋

👨‍💻 Who I am?

Hello! I am 18 years old, I live in Spain and I am a computer science student, I am interested in web development, cybersecurity and I am constantly learning about languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, Java and Shell. One of my favorite hobbies is creating discord servers for communities, streamers... In the future I want to dedicate myself professionally to the development of multiplatform and web applications.
